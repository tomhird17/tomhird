<h1> Education </h1>
<p> Growing up in Lewiston I went through the Lewiston School District and went on to earn my high school diploma from Lewiston High School. I was a member of the National Honor Society and took part in many school activities. After graduation I decided to attend Curry College, in Milton Massachusetts to play football. After a short time I realized it was not the school for me, and transferred to the University of Maine. Upon arrival at the University of Maine I began studying business management, however have specified my major to finance now. I hope to receive my degree within the next two years and then pursue my masters in finance. </p>
