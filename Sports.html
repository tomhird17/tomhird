<h1> Sports </h1>
<p> Growing up playing football and baseball in New England I naturally drew to the local professional teams such as the Red Sox, Patriots, Bruins, and Celtics. I most enjoy watching the Patriots, however I am an avid follower of all four teams. Sports go beyond just New England for me, as I enjoy watching an sporting event, such as college level sports. </P>
