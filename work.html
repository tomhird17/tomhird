		<h2>The Chick-a-dee of Lewiston</h2>
		
<P> Growing up my family has owned a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine called the Chick-a-dee of Lewiston. 
The Chick-a-dee is known for its seafood dishes, steaks, and many other menu options, as well as its bar and lounge.
 Since the age of twelve I have worked for my father starting out as a dishwasher and working my way up and through the different positions the restaurant included. 
 For the past three years I have worked as a manager and been able to learn the business aspects of running a restaurant. With this experience, as well as the desire to keep a family run business in the family, I hope to continue the Chick-a-dee as well as expand. </P>
